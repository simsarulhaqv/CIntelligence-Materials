#Genetic Algorithms

##Introduction
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. (Wikipedia definition)

Genetic algorithms view learning as a competition among population of evolving candidate problem solutions. A fitness function decide if a particular solution should contribute to next generation of solutions.
